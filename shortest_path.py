"""Task 4: Shortest Path"""

# import libraries

# make some functions that can colour network paths

# open the itn json and access the 'roadlinks' layer

# initialise a MultiDiGraph object

# make uphill directed edges adhere to Naismith's rule
#   Naismith's rule will be implemented as a ratio between vertical and horizontal travel weight
# Make downhill edges just have Naismith's weight

# do dijkstra path method on user location and high point

# Display the path
